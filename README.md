Create Read Update and Delete framework using JS

 ## Tasks

 ### Basic Reqs
- [ ] Where to store data? (localstorage)
- [ ] How to caputure data? (web form)
- [ ] How to modify data? (update action, delete action)
- [ ] How to view data? (style?)
- [ ] UI/UX considerations (how are we going to use this)

 ### Advanced Reqs
- [ ] Item that I added goes here...



I want to write a simple turn based RPG battle game:
There will be 3 main screens in the game, 
	1. A name / select your charactar screen: where you load your char if they exist already
		or create a new one if they do not exist
	2. There will be a prep phase where you can spend action points to either look for loot
		or to train their combat lvl
	3. There will be a simple combat phase where an enemy is generated with a random name 
		and combat lvl and hp
		There will be turn base combat, the player will have the option to attack, use an item
		or run.
		If the player dies it's game over and the charactar is deleted, and the game starts over
		otherwise the game loops between phase 2 and 3 until the player dies


		Local Storage:
			Will include: a player key wich holds individual player data, (hp, loot, lvl, victories, AP)
						an enemy key wich holds the current enemy data

		I am goin to expiriment with pop up windows for the player select screen and the item menu


	4. ADVANCED: 
		if I get through all of this and still have time 
			1. I would like to expand on the combat system:
				- I would like to add spcific skills to the player to deepen the battle phase
				- The player could also train specific skills in the prep phase
			2. I would like to add some more RPG elements to the prep phase:
				- Maybe scavenging for loot could have some random dialogue generated
